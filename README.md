### What is NumPy ?
<p align="justify">
NumPy stands for Numeric Python which is a python fundamental package for the scientific computation and processing. It provides a multidimensional array object, also various derived objects (such as masked arrays and matrices), and an assortment of routines for fast operations on arrays, including mathematical, logical, shape manipulation, sorting, selecting, I/O, <b>discrete Fourier transforms</b>, <b>basic linear algebra</b>, <b>basic statistical operations</b>, random simulation and much more. The NumPy package was created by <b>Travis Oliphant</b> in 2005 through injecting the features of the ancestor module Numeric into another module Numarray.
